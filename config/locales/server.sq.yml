      Mirë se vini te %{site_name} &mdash; **faleminderit që nisët një bisedë të re!**

      - A ju duket tërheqës titulli nëse e lexoni me zë të lartë? A është e mirë përmbledhja?

      - Kush do të tërhiqej nga kjo temë? Përse ka rëndësi? Çfarë reagimi prisni?

      - Përfshini fjalë të përdorura zakonisht në temën tuaj kështu që të tjerët mund **ta gjejnë** atë. Për të grupuar temën tuaj me të ngjashmet, zgjidhni një kategori.

      Për më tepër, [lexoni porositë e bashkësisë](/guidelines). Ky panel do t'ju shfaqet vetëm gjatë %{education_posts_text} tuaj të parë.

      ### How about a picture for your account?

      You’ve posted a few topics and replies, but your profile picture isn’t as unique as you are – it’s just a letter.

      Have you considered **[visiting your user profile](%{profile_path})** and uploading a picture that represents you?

      It’s easier to follow discussions and find interesting people in conversations when everyone has a unique profile picture!
    sequential_replies: |
      ### Consider replying to several posts at once

      Rather than several replies to a topic in a row, please consider a single reply that includes quotes from previous posts or @name references.

      You can edit your previous reply to add a quote by highlighting text and selecting the <b>quote reply</b> button that appears.

      It’s easier for everyone to read topics that have fewer in-depth replies versus lots of small, individual replies.
    dominating_topic: |
      ### Let others join the conversation

      This topic is clearly important to you &ndash; you've posted more than %{percent}% of the replies here.

      Are you sure you’re providing adequate time for other people to share their points of view, too?
    get_a_room: |
      ### Consider replying to more people

      You’ve already replied %{count} times to @%{reply_username} in this particular topic.

      Have you considered replying to *other* people in the discussion, too? A great discussion involves many voices and perspectives.

      If you’d like to continue your conversation with this particular user at length, [send them a personal message](/users/%{reply_username}).
    too_many_replies: |
      ### You have reached the reply limit for this topic

      We’re sorry, but new users are temporarily limited to %{newuser_max_replies_per_topic} replies in the same topic.

      Instead of adding another reply, please consider editing your previous replies, or visiting other topics.
    reviving_old_topic: |
      ### Revive this topic?

      The last reply to this topic was **%{days}** days ago. Your reply will bump the topic to the top of its list and notify anyone previously involved in the conversation.

      Are you sure you want to continue this old conversation?

    subject_template: "[%{site_name}] Email Deliverability Test"
    text_body_template: |
      This is a test email from

      [**%{base_url}**][0]

      Email deliverability is complicated. Here are a few important things you should check first:

      - Be *sure* to set the `notification email` from: address correctly in your site settings. **The domain specified in the "from" address of the emails you send is the domain your email will be validated against**.

      - Know how to view the raw source of the email in your mail client, so you can examine email headers for important clues. in Gmail, it is the "show original" option in the drop-down menu at the top right of each mail.

      - **IMPORTANT:** Does your ISP have a reverse DNS record entered to associate the domain names and IP addresses you send mail from? [Test your Reverse PTR record][2] here. If your ISP does not enter the proper reverse DNS pointer record, it's very unlikely any of your email will be delivered.

      - Is your domain's [SPF record][8] correct? [Test your SPF record][1] here. Note that TXT is the correct official record type for SPF.

      - Is your domain's [DKIM record][3] correct? This will significantly improve email deliverability. [Test your DKIM record][7] here.

      - If you run your own mail server, check to make sure the IPs of your mail server are [not on any email blacklists][4]. Also verify that it is definitely sending a fully-qualified hostname that resolves in DNS in its HELO message. If not, this will cause your email to be rejected by many mail services.

      - We highly recommend you **send a test email to [mail-tester.com][mt]** to verify that all the above is working correctly.

      (The *easy* way is to create a free account on [SendGrid][sg], [SparkPost][sp], [Mailgun][mg] or [Mailjet][mj], which have generous free mailing plans and will be fine for small communities. You'll still need to set up the SPF and DKIM records in your DNS, though!)

      We hope you received this email deliverability test OK!

      Good luck,

      ## [This is a Civilized Place for Public Discussion](#civilized)

      Please treat this discussion forum with the same respect you would a public park.  We, too, are a shared community resource &mdash; a place to share skills, knowledge and interests through ongoing conversation.

      These are not hard and fast rules, merely aids to the human judgment of our community. Use these guidelines to keep this a clean, well-lighted place for civilized public discourse.

      <a name="improve"></a>

      ## [Improve the Discussion](#improve)

      Help us make this a great place for discussion by always working to improve the discussion in some way, however small. If you are not sure your post adds to the conversation, think over what you want to say and try again later.

      The topics discussed here matter to us, and we want you to act as if they matter to you, too. Be respectful of the topics and the people discussing them, even if you disagree with some of what is being said.

      One way to improve the discussion is by discovering ones that are already happening. Please spend some time browsing the topics here before replying or starting your own, and you’ll have a better chance of meeting others who share your interests.

      <a name="agreeable"></a>

      ## [Be Agreeable, Even When You Disagree](#agreeable)

      You may wish to respond to something by disagreeing with it. That’s fine. But, remember to _criticize ideas, not people_. Please avoid:

      *   Name-calling.
      *   Ad hominem attacks.
      *   Responding to a post’s tone instead of its actual content.
      *   Knee-jerk contradiction.

      Instead, provide reasoned counter-arguments that improve the conversation.

      <a name="participate"></a>

      ## [Your Participation Counts](#participate)

      The conversations we have here set the tone for everyone. Help us influence the future of this community by choosing to engage in discussions that make this forum an interesting place to be &mdash; and avoiding those that do not.

      Discourse provides tools that enable the community to collectively identify the best (and worst) contributions: favorites, bookmarks, likes, flags, replies, edits, and so forth. Use these tools to improve your own experience, and everyone else’s, too.

      Let’s try to leave our park better than we found it.

      <a name="flag-problems"></a>

      ## [If You See a Problem, Flag It](#flag-problems)

      Moderators have special authority; they are responsible for this forum. But so are you. With your help, moderators can be community facilitators, not just janitors or police.

      When you see bad behavior, don’t reply. It encourages the bad behavior by acknowledging it, consumes your energy, and wastes everyone’s time. _Just flag it_. If enough flags accrue, action will be taken, either automatically or by moderator intervention.

      In order to maintain our community, moderators reserve the right to remove any content and any user account for any reason at any time. Moderators do not preview new posts in any way; the moderators and site operators take no responsibility for any content posted by the community.

      <a name="be-civil"></a>

      ## [Always Be Civil](#be-civil)

      Nothing sabotages a healthy conversation like rudeness:

      *   Be civil. Don’t post anything that a reasonable person would consider offensive, abusive, or hate speech.
      *   Keep it clean. Don’t post anything obscene or sexually explicit.
      *   Respect each other. Don’t harass or grief anyone, impersonate people, or expose their private information.
      *   Respect our forum. Don’t post spam or otherwise vandalize the forum.

      These are not concrete terms with precise definitions &mdash; avoid even the _appearance_ of any of these things. If you’re unsure, ask yourself how you would feel if your post was featured on the front page of the New York Times.

      This is a public forum, and search engines index these discussions. Keep the language, links, and images safe for family and friends.

      <a name="keep-tidy"></a>

      ## [Keep It Tidy](#keep-tidy)

      Make the effort to put things in the right place, so that we can spend more time discussing and less cleaning up. So:

      *   Don’t start a topic in the wrong category.
      *   Don’t cross-post the same thing in multiple topics.
      *   Don’t post no-content replies.
      *   Don’t divert a topic by changing it midstream.
      *   Don’t sign your posts &mdash; every post has your profile information attached to it.

      Rather than posting “+1” or “Agreed”, use the Like button. Rather than taking an existing topic in a radically different direction, use Reply as a Linked Topic.

      <a name="stealing"></a>

      ## [Post Only Your Own Stuff](#stealing)

      You may not post anything digital that belongs to someone else without permission. You may not post descriptions of, links to, or methods for stealing someone’s intellectual property (software, video, audio, images), or for breaking any other law.

      <a name="power"></a>

      ## [Powered by You](#power)

      This site is operated by your [friendly local staff](/about) and *you*, the community. If you have any further questions about how things should work here, open a new topic in the [site feedback category](/c/site-feedback) and let's discuss! If there's a critical or urgent issue that can't be handled by a meta topic or flag, contact us via the [staff page](/about).

      <a name="tos"></a>
